prepend.py is a way to add licensing and author information to many source
files in an easy, cross-platform manner.  You can specify the license you
wish to attach and if you also want to include additional metadata such as
the author name.  In addition, you can specify the language (python, C,
matlab, etc) being used for the files so that the proper comment symbols
can be used.

A neat feature in this script is the ability to detect the shebang line
(e.g., #!/usr/bin/csh) of a script and to skip over that line when
prending text.

This is an early version of this script, and there are many ways to improve
this such as automatic detection of source language, additional metadata,
more licenses, and the ability to specify your own license from another
source.  Maybe even allow the printing of the text to standard output,
and to allow a user to specify the comment string in case of an unknown
language (or maybe have the configuration be available as importable python
modules?).
